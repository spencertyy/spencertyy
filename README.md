## 🌿 About Me

- 🎓 Master of Software Development graduate from the University of Utah  
- 💅 Founder of **Urban Studio Nails** — built and manage a full Shopify-based e-commerce website  
- ✨ Enjoy building clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interfaces  
- 🐾 Based in the US  

I’m especially drawn to frontend engineering — turning ideas into real products, building smooth user experiences, and writing clean, maintainable code.  
I believe strong engineering skills come from consistent practice, hands-on learning, and real-world problem solving beyond the classroom.
